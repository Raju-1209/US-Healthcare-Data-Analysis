# US-Healthcare-Data-Analysis

## Project Description:

In this analysis, I explored US healthcare data to uncover demographic trends, hospital admission patterns, common medical conditions, and financial insights. The goal was to analyze patient journeys—from location and diagnosis to cost and stay duration—to generate actionable insights for healthcare improvement.

## Key Focus Areas:

✔️ Patient demographics (age, gender, blood type).

✔️ Hospital-wise and type-based admissions.

✔️ Common medical conditions & prescribed medications.

✔️ Billing patterns & insurance analysis.

✔️ Length of hospital stay vs. billing impact.

✔️ Geographic distribution of hospitals & patient flow.

## Steps Taken in the Analysis:

1️⃣ Data Source: Retrieved the dataset from Data DNA – Dataset Challenge and imported it into an Oracle Database for structured querying.

2️⃣ Data Connection: Connected Python to the Oracle DB to fetch and manipulate data efficiently. 

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Python libraries like pandas and numpy to clean, preprocess, and standardize patient, hospital, and billing data.

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis to identify trends across demographics, admission types, medical conditions, and billing.

5️⃣ Visualizations: Created meaningful plots using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to highlight patterns, distributions, and correlations.

6️⃣ Insight Generation: Derived actionable insights related to patient profiles, healthcare utilization, and financial metrics to inform strategic decisions.

## Key Insights from the Healthcare Analysis:

📌 The highest number of patients fall in the 50–60 age group, with females representing the majority. 

📌 Houston Methodist Hospital sees the most patient admissions across all types—Elective, Emergency, and Urgent. 

📌 The year 2020 recorded the highest number of admissions, totaling 11,285 patients. 

📌 Ibuprofen ranks as the most expensive medication prescribed across various medical conditions. 

📌 Patients aged 50–59 show the highest cases of Diabetes, while the 30–39 age group reports the most Cancer cases. Children aged 10–19 are notably affected by both Diabetes and Hypertension. 

📌 NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital has the lowest average billing amount, while Mayo Clinic has the highest. 

📌 Over 50% of the patients are covered under Medicare insurance. 

📌 The average hospital stay across all medical conditions is approximately 15–16 days.
